# 🧠 Universal Sales Forecasting App  
An end-to-end **Sales Forecasting System** built with **XGBoost**, **Streamlit**, and **Scikit-learn**.  
This app automatically cleans, processes, engineers features, trains a deep learning model, and generates accurate future sales forecasts for any dataset.

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ 1. Automatic Data Processing
- Upload CSV or Excel (any structure)
- Automatic date parsing & missing value handling  
- Optional grouping by store / category / item  
- Resampling to daily frequency  

### ✔ 2. Intelligent Feature Engineering
The app generates over **25 time-series features**, including:
- Year, month, day, weekday  
- Week of year  
- Weekend indicator  
- Lag features (1,2,3,4,5,7,14,30 days)  
- Moving averages (7, 9, 14, 21, 25, 28, 30 days)

### ✔ 3. XGBRegressor , RandomForestRegressor
- n_estimators=500
- learning_rate=0.03
- Mean Squared Error
- Mean Absolute Error
- R2 Score
  
### ✔ 4. Model Evaluation
- Visual comparison between **actual vs predicted** sales  
- Auto-synchronized dates  
- MinMaxScaler for stable learning  

### ✔ 5. Future Forecasting  
Predict future sales for **7–60 days** using recursive multi-step forecasting.  
All future features (lags, MA, date-based features) update dynamically during prediction.
